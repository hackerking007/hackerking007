First and foremost, I love writing code. Ever since writing my first program in C and manipulating it to produce a desired output, I have been obsessed with the idea of using software to solve practical problems.

My second internship involved injecting HTML/CSS/JavaScript and working on React.js Developing and managing several databases and reporting tools. Created Wireframes, Smart Templates, storyboards, user flows.
